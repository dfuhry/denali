VThis sets a major precedent. Had the court voted the other way, corporations could continue to "patent" natural genes that they discovered and further profit from the sole ability to treat afflictions that affect these genes.\u000a\u000aTo those that say that the lack of patents on these genes disincentivizes research, I question your source and logic-- there are other ways of profiting from this research without exclusivity on the most fundamental level.\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aThanks for the gold, very kind of you anonymous redditor!

VSo basically two rulings, directly from [the opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-398_8njq.pdf)\u000a\u000a&gt;A naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature and not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated, but cDNA (composite DNA) is patent eligible because it is not naturally occurring\u000a\u000aMore specifically on each:\u000a\u000a&gt;Myriad\u2019s DNA claim falls within the law of nature exception.  Myriad\u2019s principal contribution was uncovering the precise location and genetic sequence of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Chakrabarty, 447 U. S. 303, is central to the patent-eligibility inquiry whether such action was new \u201cwith markedly different characteristics from any found in nature."  Myriad did not create oralter either the genetic information encoded in the BCRA1 andBCRA2 genes or the genetic structure of the DNA. It found an important and useful gene, but groundbreaking, innovative, or even brilliant discovery does not by itself satisfy the §101 inquiry. Finding the location of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes does not render the genes patent eligible \u201cnew . . . composition[s] of matter.\u000a\u000a&gt;cDNA is not a \u201cproduct of nature,\u201d so it is patent eligible under §101. cDNA does not present the same obstacles to patentability as naturally occurring, isolated DNA segments. Its creation results in an exons-only molecule, which is not naturally occurring. Its order of the exons may be dictated by nature, but the lab technician unquestionably creates something new when introns are removed from a DNA sequence to make cDNA

VRuling states: "cDNA retains the naturally occurring exons of DNA, but it is distinct from the DNA from which it was derived. As a result, cDNA is not a \u201cproduct of nature\u201d and is patent eligible under §101, except insofar as very short series of DNA may have no intervening introns to remove when creating cDNA. In that situation, a short strand of cDNA may be indistinguishable from natural DNA\u201d\u000a\u000aThis is an extremely important aspect that greatly diminishes the impact of this ruling.\u000a\u000aThe language of the ruling sounds like if you take the naturally occurring mature mRNA derived from a DNA sequence and produce cDNA from that mRNA you can claim it is "synthetic" and apply for a patent. Essentially all that it takes to circumvent this ruling is to take the mRNA strand resulting from the natural process of post-transcriptional modification and intron splicing and subject it to the natural process of reverse transcription to create a cDNA strand.\u000a\u000aTo put it in very layman terms, DNA converts to mRNA before it becomes a protein and typically the process of converting DNA to mRNA involves removing regions of the DNA called "introns". Under this ruling simply converting the mRNA without introns (which are floating around in you naturally) back to DNA allows the most valuable information for the gene (the exon sequence) to still be patented.\u000a\u000aDNA/cDNA/mRNA are data formats, even though intron information is lost during the conversion the valuable data is preserved.\u000a\u000aUltimately, this seems to be a result of ignorance of what intron slicing entails on behalf of the courts.\u000a\u000aNote that Myriad Genetics stock has climbed over 6% since the ruling, people who know what they are talking about realize that this was a win for Myriad.\u000a\u000a

VThis is a terrible ruling and you all need to read an article before you start celebrating.  The supreme court said that genes are not patentable but cDNA is.  cDNA is the only form in which DNA is useful for testing. This is exactly what Myriad wanted.  the SCOTUS is trying to have its cake and eat it too, make the people happy by saying natural genes can't be patented, then make business happy by saying that cDNA can be and then rely on the masses being uninformed enough to think that this is an acceptable compromise.  \u000a\u000acDNA should NOT be patentable material.  One of the requirement for patentable material is NON-OBVIOUSNESS.  Converting something to its only useful form is OBVIOUS.

VCould some of you explain this to me? I'm a tad confused on the business end of this decision so I'll try to explain where my confusion is:\u000a\u000aThe Myriad Genetics had patents for the BRCA1/2 genes, whose presence has a positive correlation with the occurance of breast cancer. These patents existed so that Myriad could be the sole provider of this test, as no other company could perform tests on these genes. The SCOTUS decision was the the company cannot actually hold patents on this human material. The idea of this is that it opens up the field to other companies now being able to provide the same test for breast cancer, as they now have access to the gene.\u000a\u000aHowever Myriad may still copyright the cDNA. This makes no sense to me. cDNA is a copy of the DNA (inverted, but equivalent). You may not patent DNA, but you may patent the exact same, equivalent, cDNA? Would this mean that when a company patents the cDNA, they now own that cDNA. But, since cDNA is equivalent to DNA, wouldn't every company that attempted to copy the DNA for testing, create cDNA which one company now owns?\u000a\u000aDoesn't having a patent on cDNA achieve the exact same thing as having a patent on DNA? Also, Myriad's stock (MYGN) has gone up ~7% today despite 'losing' the court case. Is this because they think that they can own cDNA and thereby achieve the same thing as patenting DNA?\u000a\u000aSorry if this seems confusing, feel free to ask for clarification

VThis seems like progress but it's just a step forward after having run backward 4 miles with regard to 'intellectual property'\u000a\u000aPatents are essentially monopoly on something because you did it first. While it is a remarkable (as in you could remark about it) event, there is no reason to give somebody exclusive right over a certain configuration of objects or characters just because they were able to write it down before anybody else.\u000a\u000aAs always the big corporations that stand to gain from state-sanctioned monopoly push for IP and they always talk about encouraging advances but how does monopoly lead to advances and consumers benefit is beyond me.

VWow this is huge. For those who are unaware (and I think I have this right, please correct me if I'm wrong), a company basically held a patent claim on testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2. Testing on these genes can tell women whether or not they have a greatly increased risk of breast/ovarian cancer. The company had a monopoly on this testing and made it fairly expensive. According to this article, this ruling means that "The compromise will not stop other scientists from providing genetic diagnostic testing", which means cheaper testing.

VUnfortunately I think they are attempting to trick the public into a "good decision" when it really is not. \u000a\u000aYes they are saying you can't patent isolated DNA by itself but you CAN patent the isolated genes that are found I.e. BRCA1 and 2.\u000a\u000aBasically, DNA is made up of mostly junk except for the specific coding regions. When all the junk has been cut out of the DNA you're left with what's known as mRNA which is JUST the coding region (creates the actual protein). That is really the "gene." They are saying that cDNA which is the reverse transcription of mRNA IS patentable because its not a product of nature (even though it is. Your body cuts out the junk to form the mRNA which is what they're isolating). \u000a\u000aI would argue that mRNA is a "product of nature"  too and therefore not subject to patent laws.  Would like to hear more thoughts on this.\u000a\u000aEdit: cDNA might be patentable but mRNA is not since it's a product of nature.  That might be a work around with regards to gene patents.  They can patent the cDNA but if you just isolate the mRNA you can infer what the cDNA will look like because you just have to reverse transcribe the mRNA.  Something to keep in mind.

VOK, I've looked over OP's article and the SCOTUSblog, but I still have a practical question. Hopefully someone with advanced knowledge of molecular biology can help me, as I have a Ph.D. in Biochemistry, Cellular, and Molecular Biology, and I want to know the nitty gritty.\u000a\u000aI am researching gene X. I isolate the mRNA, and I synthesize the cDNA for gene X (because I don't feel like doing RT qRT-PCR, and qRT-PCR alone on the cDNA is faster). I find out something amazing and want to publish. Will this lead to a legal battle with a company that patented the cDNA for gene X?\u000a\u000aIf so, then this really is a shame. Considering all of the talk about not wanting to stifle innovation, cDNA synthesis is a routine procedure in molecular biology and a vital research tool.

As a result, the test has been exorbitantly expensive and locked in to one company thus discouraging competitive pricing.\u000a\u000aWe've been delaying talking about having kids because, if my wife has the syndrome, there would be a 50% chance of passing it on to our kids.

If the company was granted the patent than that could possibly lead to patient being required to pay extra for any treatment related to that specific gene (permission to use technology from the patent). This doesn't seem like a good reason for patients to pay more for their health care and it doesn't seem ethical to have companies that involved determining patient care.

VThis is an unfortunate ruling. While they declared that *naturally occurring* DNA formations cannot be patented, they explicitly left the door wide open to *artificial constructs* of DNA be patented. Meaning if you can prove you are creating a brand new sequence of DNA that doesn't naturally occur in DNA, you can patent it. That leaves all of Monsanto's bullshit patents in place.

Metabolite](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10738369373953122145&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr) was a major win for patents covering BS. \u000a\u000aI encourage people to read the dissent in Labcorp.  It is so sad that we lost the minds of Breyer, Stevens, and Souter on the court.  They actually understood the cases that came before them - Stevens especially - unlike the braintrust of Scalia, Alito, Thomas, Roberts, and Kennedy we are plagued with today.

It is, for most intents and purposes, the same as putting a patent on software, which I also have problems with.\u000a\u000aAlso, anyone else notice that Clarence Thomas wrote the unanimous decision?  It's like the supreme court got together and said "Oh shit, well lets just have Clarence write this one so he has something to do."

One of the short stories was of UCLA getting a warrant for a test subject's blood, on call, whenever, whereever, by force if needed.  The subject in question had developed a gene that was under patent by UCLA.  UCLA wanted to further cultivate the gene since he was the only living host/source.  Effectively, allowing this kind of patent set the precendent for body parts and bodily fluids of individuals to be 'Owned' by 3rd parties.\u000a\u000aI may have over-simplified or misremembered some details, but the wiki on it explains it better.\u000a\u000a interesting stuff

VI posted this in the r/biology version of this thread, but I think it's a point people are missing:\u000a\u000a&gt;It appears from a quick read that Myriad still will hold the method patent on their kit which involves cDNA sequencing of the BCRA genes. If someone develops an alternate screening method which doesn't involve an exon-only DNA sequence they'd probably be in the clear patent-wise, though they wouldn't be able to patent this sequence and thus would have to deal with competition in the market space while also having to pay to validate the kit for diagnostic approval.       \u000a&gt;I think what this decision will do is force any company who wants to make money off of a diagnostic product like this to simply follow the same cDNA process and patent both the method and cDNA sequence for the gene. In the end it frees up people to do research on whatever gene they'd like, but whether it will really drive down the cost of diagnostics is another question.\u000a\u000aThese two things combined aren't going to do much to open the market. Natural DNA is not patentable, but cDNA is. Everyone will shift to cDNA-based screening in order to retain market exclusivity and make money from their kits. \u000a\u000aWe'll have to see what comes of this:\u000a\u000a&gt;The opinion said in a footnote, however, that the Court was not actually ruling that cDNA is specifically entitled to a composition patent, and noted that the federal government had raised other objections under patent law to that phenomenon.

VI agree with the decision, but I disagree with your conclusion.  You shouldn't be able to patent something you "discover", in that we agree.\u000a\u000aHowever, the result of this will be that companies will keep their discoveries secret.  They won't publish because then they have no protection.  One of the best things about patents (and there aren't many) is that it *requires* complete disclosure, upfront.  Without patents, you end up with trade secrets, which simply can't be good for ongoing innovation.

VUnfortunately, this is *not* the practicality of the decision. For reference, I'm sitting in a breast-cancer research lab with a DNA synthesizer chugging away behind me.\u000a\u000aTo start with, the term "Gene" is to biology what the term "Aether" was to physics.  It's an antiquated concept that was a placeholder for something not yet understood. We now have an understanding of DNA and proteins that makes the concept of a gene not particularly relevant.\u000a\u000aEvery day in lab we use cDNA.  We distinguish between natural (wild-type) cDNA and synthetic chimera constructs also made from cDNA.  There is a functional distinction.  The distinction is, natural cDNA encodes for proteins in (nearly) everyone's body.  The chimeras do not.  The 'whole gene' found in the body is 95% junk and scrambled DNA - no one uses or cares about it because the body doesn't use or care about it.  And it's a trivial process to get rid of the junk.\u000a\u000aThe supreme court said 'genes are not patentable' - which is fine, but toothless as no one really knows what a 'gene' is neither is there much of a use for that 100,000 bases of junk.\u000a\u000aThen the supreme court said cDNA (of all kinds) is patentable.  Regardless if it encodes for the protein in *your* body right now, or if it encodes for a novel and creatively designed protein.  These are not distinguished.  So if I create DNA that helps you make genes you already have, that is just as patentable as if I make one with some crazy new function.\u000a\u000aThis decision will *allow* profit of the research on basic biology.  It *does* grant exclusivity on the objects I use every day in the lab to study breast cancer.  The 'genes' being protected here are of no research value.\u000a\u000aThere was a distinction to be made between cDNAs which encode for proteins found naturally, and cDNAs which encode for non-natural proteins.  That distinction was not made.  Instead a distinction was made between an ethereal 'gene' and a useful cDNA.\u000a\u000a**tldr;** functionally, this ruling is exactly opposite of what you claim.  The details are in the daily science, and the supreme court made errors of fact in their ruling to actually *allow* patentability of objects in your body right now.

The BRCA1 patent is from before the Human Genome Project. Now as soon as you can say which gene is the one to test, any grad student with a PCR machine and a gel box can test it. Even if it were patent-worthy at the time (and it probably wasn't), now it's basically like patenting a set of GPS coordinates in a public park. We don't need Myriad to tell us how.

VNot sure, Myriad Genetics' patent on the cDNA which is used for the test is still valid I think. To use their test it's still $5K, but if someone were to develop a different test, and there are quite a few you could do, the test could be cheaper. I think it would be legal to perform a [FISH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_in_situ_hybridization) to look for the mutation now because the gene no longer is patented, just the cDNA. You don't need the cDNA to run FISH, you use RNA. The sequence might be the same though, it is still a very fishy issue.

VIt's possible that this one case is different because of changes in technology since the timing when the patent was issued.  Whether cDNA is patentable in any particular case still depends on it being non-obvious, which is a question of law.  Although cDNA may be patentable subject matter, any invention of cDNA now comes from an unpatentable product of nature.  That allows cDNA to survive 101, but it's hard to see how it survives 103.  Each impotant cDNA patent will end up being litigated, with 103 being the big question.\u000a\u000atl;dr It is becoming more obvious on how to construct cDNA, making it less patentable even if the court says theoretically it is patentable subject matter.

They simply established that cDNA isn't protected as natural in the way that a gene's sequence and location are.\u000a\u000aSecond, I find it unlikely that patents on cDNA will be upheld over time.  It creates a number of arbitrary distinctions that the courts should be able to recognize, now that gDNA has been established as naturally occurring.\u000a\u000aFor instance, you can always sequence genomic DNA.  It's often easier to use cDNA, but for a diagnostic test, some PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing is sufficient.  Protecting cDNA as patentable could mean arbitrarily using a more difficult/expensive method, while both methods are ubiquitous in the field.\u000a\u000aYou could also have the weird situation where a certain process/technology is patentable for the vast majority of genes, but those that simply lack introns are excepted.  Again, this is quite arbitrary.\u000a\u000aIt's interesting to see what will happen.  I quite doubt that the cDNA distinction will be sufficient maintain patents.

There are boatloads of papers coming out showing regulatory functions for UTR and intronic DNA.  I mean come on, you couldn't splice a protein without the flanking intronic DNA.  \u000a\u000aI think you're overstating things - they are saying you can patent a process that involves the use of cDNA.  There is no danger of someone generating a massive cDNA library and patenting the whole thing.  I'll admit that I don't really see the merit in the DNA vs. cDNA distinction but at least the court's decision allows for competition, with respect to the Myriad stuff, there are plenty of other potential ways to assess mutation that don't involve cDNA.  The bigger issue is that people weren't allowed to even base things off the core genomic sequence of BRCA 1/2.  \u000a\u000aMaybe we disagree about the patent system, but I think it's flawed to think that there can/should be no profit incentive in science.  If all discovery was left solely up to publicly funded institutions we would be in a lot of trouble.  Plus, sure the patent system grants exclusive rights for 20 years but also requires 100% disclosure of methods.  Once the patent is up, everything becomes public knowledge.  From then on everyone benefits.  Without the patent system there is no reason to disclose anything.

V**"Because Myriad did create a synthetic form of the genes, however, that could be eligible for a patent, the Court concluded."**\u000a\u000aWhat exactly does this mean? What is a synthetic form of a gene that's already there in the body? If you could construct that particular nucleotide sequence "artificially" atom-by-atom/molecule-by-molecule or whatever, what did you really do other than put together a copy of the natural gene?

VcDNA being produced by other organisms is irrelevant as it's the sequence of nucleotides that is important. This is similar to DNA in that you can't patent a gene that you isolated from nature but modify the sequence or create a totally new sequence and you can patent it.\u000a\u000aFor a background cDNA is made by extracting RNA (naturally occurring) and using a reverse transcriptase enzyme (naturally occurring or modified) to convert RNA into cDNA.  So that cDNA sequence did not exist before and it is that portion of the gene that actually codes for the protein that is made.  For reference a typical gene that is not in bacteria will have huge stretches of exons ("junk DNA" it is sometimes called) that doesn't code for the final product.  So scotus has opened the door to extracting the coding sequence of a gene in RNA form, creating cDNA from it (a well established protocol) and then patenting that.  This seems very similar to what they just ruled was not eligible for a patent.  Note the method and enzymes to create cDNA should be patented.\u000a\u000aTldr: cDNA is just extracting something naturally occurring and converting its format with a well known method.  I don't like how it could be eligible for a patent.

That's what the Supreme Court has ruled patentable and why myriad still has exclusive rights to the test. The cDNA isn't being injected into anyone for a treatment. If it were, it would be patented again as a treatment for the particular disease they are trying to treat.\u000a\u000aEdit: took out wrong information

I hope redditors, most of whom are woefully under or uneducated on how business, economics, and finance work, understand that this isn't some evil ploy by an evil corporation trying to patent genes so they can control the human body or any research done on a specific gene - it's just a responsibility they have to their shareholders to make them money - money that allows them to do research and create breakthroughs in the first place. \u000a\u000aIt's great that Supreme Court ruled the way it did. As technology advances we get more and more into a gray area - like we did here - between what's naturally occurring and what is property of a company. These are necessary decisions we need to have and thankfully this one went the right way. \u000a\u000aBut don't think because this lawsuit happened in the first place that it's all bad news, i.e., like I said, that it was motivated by some evil old white CEO trying to exploit science for money. If anything, take it as a testament to how advanced our research has become that we even *have to have* this discussion. \u000a\u000aAnd i hope it inspires a conversation to talk about more government or social funding to these types of things, that could then subsequently used by companies to create treatments. I'm uncomfortable with the fact that private enterprise, basically alone, is responsible for all this work, and hopefully there can be some type of apparatus that funds this kind of research that will help us develop further. \u000a

Importantly, SEQ ID NO:1 lists only the cDNA exons in the BRCA1 gene, rather than a full DNA sequence contain- ing both exons and introns.  See id., at 779 (stating that SEQ ID NO:1\u2019s \u201cMOLECULE TYPE:\u201d is \u201ccDNA\u201d). As a result, the Federal Circuit recognized that claim 2 asserts a patent on the cDNA nucleotide sequence listed in SEQ ID NO:1, which codes for the typical BRCA1 gene.\u000a\u000a(page 8 of the [pdf](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-398_8njq.pdf))

However, instead of making another RNA copy, you use DNA.

A lot of people probably write that off due to him being sort of a pop author for the last 20 years and being the source for awful movies with Paul Walker (*Timeline*....shudder.) but the guy did his homework and presented some pretty effed up legal gray areas in a digestible format. \u000a\u000a[For anyone wondering - here's his Op-Ed in the NYT from 2007.](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/13/opinion/13crichton.html?_r=0)\u000a\u000a"Humans share mostly the same genes. The same genes are found in other animals as well. Our genetic makeup represents the common heritage of all life on earth. You can\u2019t patent snow, eagles or gravity, and you shouldn\u2019t be able to patent genes, either. Yet by now one-fifth of the genes in your body are privately owned."\u000a\u000aGreat ruling today, but there needs to be another more specific ruling to really, REALLY lay some groundwork.

VThe whole thing is very complicated if you think about the future of technology. Right now it would be very difficult (impossible) to create a brand new gene that does exactly what you want it to, and it doesn't exist in nature. but in the future that could be a possibility.\u000a\u000aIt is ridiculous to think you could patent an existing gene and call it yours. You can patent a process for creation of cDNA (but every lab in the country has been doing it for the past 40 years) but what about a variant of a current gene that produces specific results?\u000a\u000aA variant of a gene could potentially be created in a lab but how do you guarantee it doesn't exist naturally or will exist in the future through mutation?\u000a\u000aTake insulin for example.

Is a naturally occurring mushroom a new and useful composition of matter?\u000a\u000aedit:  I'm also worried about that cDNA exclusion.  It's important to realize that the cDNA comes from the RNA which can be quite different from the original DNA (as it is subject to alternative splicing and such).  So, although the cDNA is not naturally occurring, all they did was isolate a naturally occurring RNA and toss it in a tube with a naturally occurring enzyme (reverse transcriptase) which then naturally created the cDNA.  In fact, you could argue that the cDNA may, in fact, be occasionally naturally occurring in the event of say, a retroviral infection which could supply a natural reverse transcriptase to the cell.  Sure, it'd be rare, but it *would* be natural.  (note: I'm a molecular biologist).

V&gt;People publish, especially in academia and federally funded research.\u000a\u000aBut that's it. If you're doing private sector research for a company, there's an economic incentive to not share your research so that your company can gain a competitive edge. Also, you can form non-disclosure agreements to legal protect your product if you have to share it with another company or government agency. The benefit of non-disclosure agreements is that if you can prove that the person you shared your product with ended up spilling the beans to a third party, you can sue them for major cash. However, if your trade secret is revealed by someone who did not sign an agreement, it becomes public domain.\u000a\u000aIn effect, the benefit of keeping something a trade secret is that you can be the sole provider of your product for years, until someone else figures out your secret. This is basically what Coca-Cola does with it's recipe. However, if you get your product patented, you trade full disclosure for guaranteed rights for x number of years.

V&gt;Not sure what you mean by 'Discover'. It is true you cannot patent naturally occuring processes or objects. If you 'discover' a new way of doing something that is not patented, you may patent it.\u000a\u000aI think they used "discover" in contrast to "invent" or "create." Have you ever heard someone slip up by saying Benjamin Franklin "invented" electricity? It's like that. He didn't invent it, he just found out it existed (at least for the purposes of this example). A method of doing something, on the other hand, would not have already existed in nature and could be said to have been invented or created.

VI am certainly overstating things.  I can mollify your comment by stating that currently, today, the coding sequence of a cDNA is tantamount to the 'gene' we use therapeutically and in research.  It is absolutely the case that the introns and exons have some biological value, and their structure in the genome is of amazing study.  And just inserting a random coding sequencing into a genome will not produce the same biological results as a 'gene coding region'.  However, for the purposes of this case the whole gene is never (in a patentable timeline - say 20 years) going to be isolated for protein coding purposes or therapeutic purposes.  Whereas the cDNA *is* the gene, as we know it - and even the WT sequence is now patented.

And that a functional protein should be patentable - much like a little machine.\u000a\u000aThe issue of flexibility in codon usage is likely the most damaging (to the defendants) part of yesterday's ruling.  If you read their argument they ask to be granted a patent on any 15bp+ sequence found in their cDNA.  And the court said, "if you find the sequence in the genome, you can't patent it".  Kind of a weird standard - but it definitely clears up the primer issue.  Though it would suggest weird ways to get around them by altering them with a single silent mutation.\u000a\u000aUsually in the filing of a patent you have to demonstrate some novel function.

Honestly though, as was hinted on the blog, the cDNA sequence may not "exist" in nature, but it is encoded in nature. The mRNA is naturally occuring, so who cares if the cDNA is or isn't, it's just a "translated" version of the same sequence. It DOES exist in nature, and the method of creating cDNA from mRNA is nothing new.

VThe case was *entirely* about the eligibility to be patented, not the merits of the patent.\u000a\u000aThe cDNA is never actually found in nature.  It's actually the exact same sequence made of RNA (mRNA).  In that sense, the cDNA is *not* a product of nature (you can't find it anywhere in nature).\u000a\u000a*However*, it's a pretty stupid transition from mRNA to cDNA.  It's trivial.  Little more than a photocopy onto different paper. So it's an obvious transformation from a natural product.\u000a\u000aIn that way, an additional case could be brought that says, "The supreme court said this is not a product of nature (which it's not), but that this could be a trivial change from nature".  And therefore the natural cDNA would be eligible to file a patent, but would fail tests for novelty and thus not granted a patent.\u000a\u000aThis is likely to be true.  You can't patent salt water because it's found in nature.  You can't patent salt water with a pH of 7.222343 because it has exactly 9 billion Calcium ions in it, not because it has never been found in nature, but because it's an obvious derivative of something that was found in nature.

When prosecuting the patent (trying to have the application approved) or defending against a legal challenge to the patent's validity (you say I'm infringing your patent, I say your patent is invalid), the Patent Office or a challenger may argue that the process and resulting product of cDNA is nonobvious, which is harder to dispute nowadays.

VI think RobNine may have meant is if they are injecting cDNA into ooctyes or fertilized eggs in human's to give functional copies of genes for couples with a high risk of passing on dysfunctional copies of BRCA1 or other genes. If so, they will likely be injecting the full gene, not the cDNA, into human oocytes/fertilized oocytes because we already have the machinery to appropriately splice the gene.  I'm assuming they would use some sort of "knock in" technique by taking advantage of homologous recombination so they get correct expression levels naturally in the correct tissue.  There is no purpose in giving humans the cDNA over the actually sequence of DNA a normal human would have.  This would mean that there are no patents involved on anything that was actually injected.  This is the only interpretation of RobNine's comment that made sense to me.  I could be wrong though.

So if you patent the handful of mutations that cause the A206K substitution, then you have an exclusive right to this useful mutant GFP.

VAbstract things can be patented. Look at the whole field of [business method patents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_method_patent). I actually looked into patenting one myself. (Granted, they are under review and evolving.)\u000a\u000aIn reality, it is abstract things, ideas, that are patented. It is the combination of abstract principles to achieve some tangible goal that gets the patent. If it were the physical manifestation that was patented they you could change a screw, or the colour, or make it bigger or smaller, or some such minor change and make it "different". If you read them (or write them, a painful endeavor) they consist of claims with descriptions like "a lever mechanism as per claim that induces a force in the latch such that it moves away from the holder ..." where the lever, latch, and holder would all be defined in other claims in the list. The size, shape, and design of them doesn't really matter as long as they function as described.\u000a\u000aAs for what is *reasonable*, the principle of patents, or intellectual property in general, is to provide an incentive to generate *and publish* new and non-obvious ideas so that others can learn and build from it. There is an inherent balance, obviously. Too little/short control over it means the incentive goes away and fewer works are created and/or published. Too much/long control over it and fewer people will exploit it or build from it. Maximizing progress means hitting the right balance.\u000a\u000aSo what is *reasonable* is anything that (a) is sufficiently "smart" that it isn't something that would commonly be created anyway, (b) would be unlikely to be shared if there was no IP protection, (c) falls in a category that might conceivably provide value to the human condition. (Note by (c) I don't mean that the idea itself might conceivably provide value, but that the category of "things" it falls in might.)\u000a\u000aNatural things fail (a) since anybody would find the same thing. "Research method" is pretty vague so it's hard to say. If it's just applying a standard method to a new thing, that seem to fail (a) and (b). If the method requires the invention of a new  technique at great expense that is unlikely to have occurred to anybody else and is valuable to humans, it seems obvious that it should be patentable otherwise who would undertake the work, or publish the method, only to never make their investment back.\u000a\u000aOf course publicly funded science is a different story since *we* are the investor.

VThey can use some specific restriction enzymes to isolate the sequence (think of these enzymes as sequence-specific DNA scissors), then design specific primers to amplify the DNA and create cDNA from this non-patentable parental or natural template using a patented and well-documented reaction called a polymerase chain reaction that has been standard in the field for maybe two decades (fancy reaction that makes millions of copies of cDNA).  I could probably do this in about a week, in my own lab bench.  Let's say I was interested in studying this gene in a mouse model-as of recently, I would not have been able to do this because Myriad would claim patent infringement.  Even if my research wanted to understand the mechanism by which this gene increases the propensity to breast cancer and had nothing to do with their diagnostic test, they would shut my lab down.  They did not invent this process and is standard in industry.  The process itself is not novel.  It is the identification of that particular gene and its relevance to breast cancer that was novel, not the molecular procedure followed to isolate it.  The techniques necessary to isolate the particular gene from its source are separate from the diagnostic test, the proprietary component of this.  The basis of this proprietary right is that they know the sequence, not how to isolate it.  Anyhow, the supreme court decision states they cannot hold a patent to the original template or naturally occurring sequence found in our cells.  Myriad genetics claimed by virtue of identification or discovery, they held a patent on this gene, making it impossible for other research labs to conduct medically relevant research that didn't have much to do with the actual diagnostic test, simply because this type of research would also require the scientist on the bench to use that original sequence found in cells (that they identified-actually it was identified through tax payers money by sources funded by the federal government but the scientist(s) later founded Myriad) as a starting point for their own research.  So you (tax payer) payed for this foundational research in either the late 80s or early 90s, a company was made to exploit this via their federally sanctioned monopoly, and now you get to pay about $7000 for this diagnostic.  I realize this is a whole different set of ethical issues that have not even been mentioned.   \u000a\u000aEdit: spelling

It's just someone got there first and patented the idea of a virtual website shopping cart.\u000a\u000aIs this anything like what is happening in genetic research?  Is it really innovative to hypothesize that a breast cancer gene exists, and then isolate it?  -- When the innovative processes and methods used to do so can be separately patented?  You're basically making an hypothesis of the identity of a highly likely thing and engaging in experiments and tests to characterize, prove or disprove it.  That's scientific method, not invention.  And just because you're the first one to isolate it, like with the first guys to make website shopping carts, because the ability and need didn't come together to exist before, that doesn't mean the gene was unlikely to have been found by others of your era given the same problem to solve and the level of technological advancement of the period.  It turns out anyone who makes a website for shopping needs something like a shopping cart object and people were "inventing" the obvious solution to the problem independently.\u000a\u000aAn invention has to not be obvious to anyone else solving the problems at the same time period.  Obviousness is one of the criteria for patentability that I think is implicit in the issues that arise when patenting natural products.  Obviousness is a subtle question that the patent office hasn't handle well, IMO.  \u000a\u000aIn this case, how much of a leap is it really to suppose that a breast cancer gene may exist and how inventive do you have to be to find/isolate it, given state of the art methods, as opposed to being the fastest and the first in a rush of researchers?

VYes.  In fact, recently laws and interpretations of cases have made it more and more difficult to obtain and enforce patents.  The result has been a large upswing in trade secrets.  \u000a\u000aThe inherent problem in filing for a patent is that you immediately lose the option of obtaining trade secret protection since it enters public domain. If your patent application is denied, your SOL.\u000a\u000aOn a side note, if one is confident the patent can be obtained, there are ways to patent the basic technology and keep an improvement a trade secret. Thereby you protect the 'discovery' you believe has the most risk of being developed fast by others, and keep the trade secret for the improvement or essential part that is very hard to reverse-engineer or figure out independently.\u000a\u000a

VYou are right that junk DNA does not code for proteins.  But you stated, "...no one uses or cares about it because the body doesn't use or care about it" in reference to junk DNA.  This statement simply stated, is false-not true.  Just because it does not code for protein does not mean the "body does not use it" or that no one cares about it.  I think others have pointed this out.  I suppose it is relevant in that non-protein coding DNA sequences could not be patented however cDNA could.  So if we are able to elucidate a process or regulatory component of junk DNA and recreate this process for therapeutic purposes (or diagnostic, as I suspect several diseases are caused from regulatory cellular processes, not limited to protein synthesis) then patenting laws would be relevant.  Frankly, I think few people would disagree that thinking of this topic from the standpoint of only protein coding sequences is narrow, considering how important other DNA sequences seem to be.

VLet me try to explain it as I think I understand his, and many redditors', point of confusion.\u000a\u000aThere are many types of DNA, the two of most importance to this discussion are regular chromosomal DNA, and Complementary DNA (cDNA). The difference between the two is that chromosomal DNA doesn't just include the information to encode for proteins, it is made of introns and exons. Exons are the information for the proteins and coding instructions, introns are sort of like interference, they don't encode anything. Thats not to say they dont have a purpose, they just arent specifically used for protein synthesis. During the process of transcription, in which RNA is encoded from DNA strands, the introns are removed, so RNA is all of the exons attached (so its only the protein encoding stuff). Which brings us back to the question of how complementary DNA is different from chromosomal DNA, and that difference is that complementary DNA is artificially created DNA by going through reverse transcription, RNA -&gt; DNA, which produces DNA that is only made of exons. Its a compressed version of DNA that deals exclusively with protein creation.\u000a\u000aComplementary DNA can still be patented, chromosomal DNA cannot be.

Yes, it's synthesized in vitro, but it's derived from the endogenous mRNA which is itself derived from the endogenous gene. I'm not really understanding their logic here. I can't patent the introns and the exons that exist in vivo, but I can patent the exons in vitro? If you're manipulating the cDNA further such that you create some novel form of that gene, then yes, you should be able to patent that. Otherwise I think not.

The process of making cDNA is not unique and is used all the time by geneticists.  It is part of the ordinary course of business.  If you want to look at a gene, you make a synthetic version of it that removes all the unnecessary muck.  In other words, it is obvious to people working in the field.

Patenting software or other forms of instructions should also be strictly verboten. \u000a\u000aPatents should take a strict and narrow interpretation of the machines under patent, such that any single change to a physical structure of the machine -- even so slight as placing a screw in a different location -- should constitute a new machine eligible for its own patent.

VActually, that analogy falters too.  I had to review a law review article submitted for my law review last year on this issue.  The fact is that you cannot come up with a good analogy.  It is a completely novel situation.  The leaves from a tree are readily apparent and naturally separate themselves for purposes of discovery.  Genes, as separated from the genome, are not naturally occurring.  Genes are wrapped around histones subject to epigenetic regulation AND connected to an entire chomosome.  In order to get to the genes, you need to separate the genes away from the surrounding proteins and structures of epigenetic regulation, copy the genes, and then reverse engineer the genes from that copy.  The closest analogy I can think of is taking an image (cDNA) of a bat that is stuck inside a tree (DNA in its native structure), and reverse engineering the bat in a way that is outside of the tree (the gene as it is outside of nature).

VSort of. The problem is that all genes are unique. They didn't create a *new* gene, they just created a new way of isolating the already existing gene. So the process should be patentable, the gene not. However, if they were to create an entirely new gene, that should be patentable. But that's not what they did. Another analogy would be that: I figured out that if I put a tap into a maple tree, I get maple syrup. Therefore, I can patent maple syrup. I can patent the tap system, but not the product (because the product exists regardless of whether or not I extract it from trees). BRCA1/2 exist regardless of whether or not you look for them.

This formation of rock is valuable only in the manner in which it is formed (meaning the rocks themselves are meaningless but once you know how they are structured that is what matters).  No one knows how to get to those rocks to see the structure without destroying the formation.  Someone then discovers how.  He wants to patent the formation of rocks because that is what is valuable, not his method of getting to the formation without destroying it because, as I said, the rocks themselves are worthless.  He wants everyone to pay him for the formation's structure because that is what is valuable and that is what he toiled for.  But the supreme court said he cant.  He cannot profit on his hard labor because that formation was naturally occurring even if impossible to get to but for this persons work.

VYou're obviously missing a lot of what's actually going on. That company still has a patent on the cDNA version of it, and as such can monetize their findings extremely well. They're still the only company on the planet that actually has a functional test for BRCA1/2 on the market, and as such can continue to sell it for as much as they have been. All this ruling does is say they don't own the idea such that other people can't look for the test as well. \u000a\u000aBasic economics supports this position also. Monopolies are bad for everyone except the monopoly. This decision allows them to keep making money off their research until a competitor produces a competitive product, at which point they'll be subject to competition pricing. It should also be noted that this is the same way big pharma operates. One company creates a drug, company B-E create drugs similar to it to compete. This ruling basically only says you can't patent something you didn't make. You can patent a process, but not something that isn't yours to patent.

VYeah, that pretty much sums it up...just to clarify, exons are the coding bits that go into mRNA -&gt; Protein.  Introns and UTRs (Untranslated Regions) were always regarded as junk DNA but are now being found to have useful regulatory roles.  Will those roles be useful for something like drug targeting?  Maybe, but probably not nearly as useful as coding sequence that would be made into cDNA.  \u000a\u000aIn some ways it's a hollow ruling as you point out.  But basically what it boils down to is that now anyone will be able to work with the BRCA 1/2 gene (or any gene) to develop new tests for detecting mutations.  There are other ways that do not involve cDNA.  Actually, methods involving cDNA are probably rapidly going to become obsolete and irrelevant.  All you really need to do is next generation deep sequencing of the persons genome and align it to readily available reference genomes.  The positive part of the Supreme Court verdict would apply to any genomic sequence, with no chance to patent it.  In this manner, any mutation can be detected, probably with a greater accuracy than any cDNA based PCR test.  Deep sequencing is expensive now, but will be cheaper and no one can really have a monopoly on it since any company could buy a machine and offer the service.\u000a \u000aThere are already several companies offering full sequencing of the BRCA 1/2 locus for a 1/4 of the cost of the Myriad PCR test.

It does not make it wrong. Every company that has made great advances has done so under the umbrella of capital intensive R&amp;D, which exists only because there is a apparatus for funding for it.\u000a\u000aInvestments from shareholders is not the only source of R&amp;D capital. A a large portion comes from the government which might reap better returns with lower IP protection since the information would be disseminated more quickly and employ more people.\u000a\u000a\u000aMy general points are that 1) profit motive does not indicate morality or lack thereof and 2) that too much intellectual property protection (control) is a bad thing for society even though it benefits specific companies. I would also like to add and clarify that to little IP protection is also bad for society as a whole and for individual companies.

So each tree you plant from seed you get a random, never seen before variety. Which is great actually, you just aren't going to get something like a red delicious by planting a red delicious seed.

VIt seems akin to making pharmaceuticals. Instead of marketing the natural compound, which is found in plant material, make a synthetic analog tweaked ever so slightly and patent that instead. \u000a\u000aGenes are really just paired nucleotides (adenine, thymine, guanine, cytosine) that do occur outside of the genome. The parts and pieces are naturally occurring. This is how a lot of biotechnology works. Someone figures out the gene sequence for a certain gene. ~~Then we take our nifty nucleotides and sequence that gene and boom we have a gene to insert, study, etc.~~ \u000a\u000aI remember learning about the breast cancer gene issue in my genetics class and couldn't fathom how someone could pull off patenting the instruction manual of the human body. Also since genes can be sequenced once someone knows the structure it was funny that it could be illegal to make it. \u000a\u000aEdit: Sorry I used sequencing incorrectly. Instead they use RNA, enzymes, and bacteria to cut and insert genes into genomes. I thought I remembered reading that they could bind pairs, but I'm not sure now.

If I produce a drug and patent it, my competitors will look at the drug and reverse-engineer through computer modeling where it is working, regardless of whether or not I disclose how it works.

Instead of patenting the chemical, I patent the effect-site. Now I can disclose the effect-site freely because no one else can ever make a drug that affects it.

V&gt; Investments from shareholders is not the only source of R&amp;D capital. A a large portion comes from the government which might reap better returns with lower IP protection since the information would be disseminated more quickly and employ more people.\u000a\u000aThat's completely incorrect. \u000a\u000aAt the academic level, yes, the government funds R&amp;D. But look at any balance sheet for a corporation doing major research - if it's private, it's from PE funding, individual purchases of private shares, or institutional share purchases (most of which come from when Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan invests into it). Government funding only happens [*after* the company can provide proof that it has a viable product](http://articles.latimes.com/2011/may/04/news/la-heb-stem-cells-cirm-geron-trial-20110504), and these are usually few and far between, especially in the biomedical sector. But these companies doing groundbreaking research, such as Myriad, require initial capital to fund their projects - it doesn't come from the government, at all. So no, you're not even close; only a very small portion of R&amp;D funding comes from the government. (By the way, the government only spends about half as much as the private sector does on R&amp;D.) \u000a

It would just have required that Merck obtain a license from Sankyo.  \u000a\u000aNow, would Sankyo have been well advised to keep their discovery secret, and develop their own drug in clandestine labs, requiring other manufacturers to wait until Sankyo released a drug and then try and figure out why it works before trying to develop their own drug.

VI can see your point, but I think at the heart of this is that an idea or information about something shouldn't be patentable whereas an actual application for such information should be. If Sankyo had patented the information somehow it's entirely possible that Merck couldn't have afforded the license or that Sankyo would have refused licensing agreements in lieu of creating his own drug anyway. Now you have a scenario where there is only one manufacturer possible until patents expire. \u000a\u000aQuestion: Do those patents have time limits like the drugs themselves? You said the patent would have ended by 1989. I know that drug manufacturers have a 20 year patent from the time of filing their IND. Do research patents have similar limitations? Because patents in other sectors are lifetime duration (which if applicable would effectively set an indefinite monopoly).

Vthey can control the replication but they've ben hesitant to roll out the termination seeds preferring to have it as an option if they can't keep people from replanting the seeds after a season. The cross-pollinating thing is kind of fucked up though

VJust because an article comes up on google, does not make it factual.\u000a\u000aOsgata v Monsanto was **organic farmers suing Monsanto**, not the other way around, (hence the v Monsanto, and not Monsanto v) and the judge dismissed the case because it had no merit. The case asserted what you started with about Monsanto going after accidental cross pollination. Osgata could not produce any evidence that this had happened, so the case was dismissed. You don't 'lose rights' by your case being dismissed.\u000a\u000aThe 'Monsanto will sue for simple cross pollination' myth comes from the Percy Schmeiser case. Percy sprayed his growing crop with roundup, harvested the survivors, and replanted, and repeated, thereby actively selecting for the roundup ready trait, and then claiming that he had permanent rights to use it because 'it grew on my farm'. That's not how patent law works.\u000a\u000aNo farmer ever sprays a growing seed crop with roundup that is not roundup resistant. Why? It kills the crop. Percy willfully selected for the RR trait. It is impossible for cross pollination to make a growing first generation plant immune, because pollination affects the *offspring* of a plant, not the plant itself.\u000a\u000aEven if you had cross pollination, if you never sprayed the crop with roundup, you would not actually be using the trait that you did not own. If Monsanto tried to sue because the trait existed, yet you did not use it, the case would get thrown out of court, because you can't be sued for not using something that you're not authorized to use.

VAll utility patents, regardless of field, are 20 years long.  Prior to 95 it was 17 years, but with "trickery" (my term) you could finagle that up to 20 years.  \u000a\u000aThe only other type of patents are "design patents" which aren't really applicable here (there for things like clothing, or furniture, or things like that).  They have a term of 14 years.

V&gt;Do you disagree? Why? What value do patents provide toward the stated goal of fostering innovation? \u000a\u000aDo I disagree with the insane statement that patents are *useless*? Absolutely. If I invent a widget with **no** patent protection, what's to stop Apple/Google/Samsung/etc. from just making it and selling it? I don't have their resources. I cannot rely on trade secrets if I'm going to get my product to market.\u000a\u000a&gt;surely you agree that patents these days are overly broad?\u000a\u000aAbsolutely... which is a **very** different thing than asserting that patents are "already useless".\u000a\u000a&gt;Some form of stricter interpretation is necessary, yes? \u000a\u000aObviously.
