## The Callback System

*Denali* provides a flexible and powerful callback system for invoking processes
upon the user selecting a component of the landscape. Some features of the
system include:

- Callbacks may be written in any language
- Interprocess communication is done via flat file &mdash; there is no
  dependency on a 3rd party messaging library
- Callbacks can print to the status box, and even change the landscape that is
  being visualized.
